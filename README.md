## 🎮 About This Game

The **Life Planning Challenge** is an interactive decision-making game threaded throughout SOC-213 (Sociology of the Family). Students make sequential life decisions across 8 modules and experience how choices in one domain (education, career, relationships, family formation, finances) cascade through all others.

**This game is NOT a test.** There are no "right" or "wrong" decisions. The goal is to demonstrate how family is an interconnected system shaped by structural forces, not just personal choices.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Through this game, students will:

1. **Experience Systems Thinking:** Understand how family decisions are interconnected, not isolated
2. **Recognize Structural Constraints:** See how economics, gender, education, and policy constrain "personal" choices
3. **Apply Life Course Perspective:** Experience how early decisions affect later options
4. **Build Empathy:** Try different paths and understand diverse family experiences
5. **Connect Theory to Experience:** Reflect on game experiences using sociological concepts and research

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### **Pedagogical Principles:**

1. **Experiential Learning:** Students learn by doing, not just reading
2. **Consequential Choices:** Decisions have visible, realistic consequences
3. **No Judgment:** All paths are valid; goal is understanding, not "winning"
4. **Connected to Theory:** Every game element ties to sociological concepts
5. **Reflection-Driven:** Game experience becomes data for sociological analysis

### **Game Design Principles:**

1. **Realistic Scenarios:** Based on sociological research and real family experiences
2. **Structural Forces Visible:** Economics, gender, time, resources shown explicitly
3. **Cascading Consequences:** Early decisions constrain/enable later options
4. **Multiple Paths:** Students can replay to see different outcomes
5. **Data Exportable:** Students own and control their game data

## 📚 Sociological Concepts Demonstrated

The game makes these abstract sociological concepts concrete and experiential:

- **Life Course Perspective:** Timing and sequencing of life events
- **Structural Constraints:** How institutions shape choices
- **Intersectionality:** How gender, class, race affect opportunities
- **Work-Family Conflict:** Time squeeze and resource tradeoffs
- **Economic Inequality:** How resources shape family formation
- **Homogamy:** Tendency to partner within same education/class
- **Second Shift:** Gendered household labor
- **Family Diversity:** Multiple valid family forms

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **My progress disappeared!**
- Did you clear your browser data? That deletes localStorage.
- Did you switch browsers? Each browser has separate storage.
- **Solution:** Export your data regularly! Upload exports to Canvas.

### **The export button isn't working!**
- Make sure you've completed at least one module first.
- Check if downloads are blocked in your browser.
- Try a different browser.

### **I want to restart the game completely.**
- Open browser console (F12)
- Type: `localStorage.removeItem('lifePlanningGame')`
- Refresh the page

### **Mobile version looks weird.**
- The game is mobile-responsive, but best experienced on desktop/tablet
- Try rotating your device to landscape mode
